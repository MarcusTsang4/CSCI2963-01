The ten criteria for open source not only allows anyone to utilize other people's source code freely but to also give credit where credit is due as well as to not deceive source code users. The following criteria: Free Redistribution, Source Code, Derived Works, No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups, No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor, and License Must Not Restrict Other Software give people the opportunity to work on/expand the open source code with minimized hinderances. Those who utilize the open source code can create and publish their modifications openly, ultimately adding to the growing open source community. The criteria Distribution of License, License Must Not Be Specific to a Product, and License Must Be Technology-Neutral all contribute to the protection of open source software and the respective rights.

Eric Raymond's article was very insightful as to the thoughts of those who constantly help those with technical questions. Some of the key points that stood out included taking pretty much every measure to ensure that your problem has not already been solved. As many people tend to rush to get their problem answered by another almost instantly, they do not realize that there is a good chance it has already been solved. The ones who answered the question in the past have taken time already out their schedule to help someone, therefore, spending an hour or so going through search results are worth it. Another point that stood out was that the amount of time you spend on trying to solve the problem will have a decent correlation to the quality of the response. By taking time to show the steps you have taken, others can paint a better picture of what is going on. The responses are from humans too, so taking up as little of their time is valuable.

##Two Suggestions for How To Answer Questions in a Helpful Way
1. Allocate enough time for others. Do not be hasty in expecting a response.
2. Along the lines of being couteous, do not go overboard with the amount of text and descriptive ways of appearing polite. Some may interpret this as fluff and lose interest in the real problem.

##Project Reflection
One potential project that is of interest would be a mobile app that allows students to list the textbooks they are individually selling. This mobile app would be able to sort the textbooks that everyone posts into the subject categories, possibly even the specific courses, allowing for a quicker search. Another possible feature would be to recognize the proper version of a textbook that a specific courses uses and displays the information (so the students can locate the correct version). This would allow students to lessen the amount of time. Another potential project would involve an Arduino. The project could be some sort of monitoring system that tracks when a student is possibly falling asleep and then notifies the user to wake up. Having worked with Arduinos in the past, I would feel comfortable working on such a project.
