##Why it is important to choose a license
The main reasons that it is important to utilize a license is because it provides permission first to use the software, study/audit the software, modify the software, and redistribute the software. Having all these freedoms provides the oppportunity to create a community whose goal is to improve the software as well as give proper feedback. By choosing a license, you have more access to an abundant amount of sources.

##Why they shouldn't use a project that doesn't have an explicit license
Utilizing a project that does not have an explicit license implies that the general copyright laws take effect. These copyright laws prohibit the ability for others to use the software, modify the software, or redistribute the software. If one does choose to use a project that does not have an explicit license, there is a high possibility of legal repercussions.

##Linux using the GPL v2 License
The license that Linux uses is the General Pulic License v2. This license provides the freedom to copy, distribute, and modify the software while tracking all changes in the source files. This is prevelant for Linux because there are many different Linux distributions. There are many distributions including Ubuntu, Arch Linux, Fedora, Gentoo, and much more. It is even stated that Linux is "freely distributable, anyone may create a distribution for any intended use."
